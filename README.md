# Day-Of-The-Week
This is not a serious project, it was just something I thought I could implement with my understnading of dictionaries in python, im not expert, 
but I am getting better.

I am also starting to really enjoy learning new concepts, I am thinking of my next mini project and hopefully it involves graphs because
currently I am learing how they opperate and I gotta say, it is very interesting. 

I haven't created any projects in a while, mainly because I felt I lacked the fundementals. I have been doing a bunch of problems from project euler, leetcode, 
code forces, and hackerrank and I realise I have so much to learn before I make a high quality piece of code anytime soon.

From the last statement, I have also taken a liking to competitive programming, so I think I will try and learn as much as I can from those types of problems 
before creating another project, I might not make anything else soon, so goodbye for now.
